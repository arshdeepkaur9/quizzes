1. Cost of delay is not applicable for prioritizing features that create revenue.
  - True
  - False (*)

2. Which of the following best describes the concept of the "fuzzy front-end"?
  - Early mockups of a user interface
  - The early stages of new product or project initiation (*)
  - An over-emphasis on usability at the expense of features that provide business value

3. Which of the following best describes the Moscow prioritization scheme?

- Communal decision-making
- Dictatorial decision-making
- Must Should Could and Won't (*)
- Might Should Can't and Wasted

4. Des Traynor proposes the following prioritization framework for considering implementing a new feature:

- Number of customers and value of each feature
- Number of customers and frequency of use (*)
- Frequency of use and cost of building each feature

5. Prior to their adoption of cost-of-delay prioritization, Maersk features spent most of their time...

- in testing
- in prioritization
- awaiting prioritization (*)
- in development
- in QA

6. Which of the following describes Maersk's prioritization practices prior to adopting cost-of-delay? Select all that apply.

- Features were given relatively uniform priorities; all features in the backlog were treated with equal priority (*)
- Many features did not receive timely prioritization (*)
- Often times highly paid, powerful employees played an outsize role in prioritization (*)
- It was strictly democratic due to the Danish culture

7. Which of the following best describes the statistical distribution of the value of features in Maersk's backlog?

- They are relatively uniform; that is, they have roughly the same value
- They are normally distributed; that is, they look like a bell curve
- They have high skew; that is, few features have ultra-high value and many low value (*)
- It was impossible to predict the value making prioritizing challenging

1. Why does dividing Cost of Delay by Duration (CD3) tend to encourage better development practices?

- It forces teams to work faster to meet deadlines
- It penalizes complex features that take longer to build
- It encourages breaking work into smaller batches that deliver value sooner (*)
- It helps identify which features are most expensive
- It ensures the team stays busy with a full backlog

2. What key insight about value distribution did the Maersk case reveal?

- Most features deliver roughly equal business value
- Value follows a normal (bell curve) distribution
- A small number of features deliver dramatically more value than others (*)
- Features become more valuable over time as they mature
- The most expensive features to build generate the most value

4. What is the fundamental flaw in trying to "hold people accountable" for their value estimates?

- It wastes time checking estimates against actuals
- It creates fear of proposing innovative ideas with uncertain outcomes (*)
- It requires too much documentation and tracking
- It slows down the approval process
- It makes estimates unnecessarily precise

5. According to the case, what is a better approach than focusing on saying "no" to low-value features?

- Creating more rigorous analysis processes
- Building political support for rejections
- Keeping all ideas in storage and quickly saying "yes" to high-value ones (*)
- Implementing strict prioritization criteria
- Requiring detailed business cases

6. You have features flags that can be "on" or "off" Imagine you have one for
the reporting tool, one for the social media integration, one for the invoice analytics,
and one for the invoicing. How many possible UI states are there? That
is, how many ways might your app work and therefore require testing?

- 2
- 4
- 8
- 16 (*)

7. Des Traynor suggests that "when you have time to lean, you have time to clean." What does he mean by this?

- When you have extra time, you should clean up your code and pay down technical debt. (*)
- When you have extra time, you should take a break and relax.
- When you have extra time, you should work on new features that make the UI cleaner.
- When you have extra time, you should clean your desk and workspace.
