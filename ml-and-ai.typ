+ Why is the term "intelligence" complex when discussing AI systems?
  - [x] Intelligence involves multiple capabilities working together rather than a single definable trait
  - [ ] Intelligence is only found in human brains and those of higher primates.
  - [ ] Intelligence violates one of the precepts of the Agile Manifesto: "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind."

+ What does the presence of bias in AI systems reveal about the relationship between technology and society?
  - [x] Technology reflects and can amplify the existing patterns and biases in our society
  - [ ] Bias comes from bad programming and architecture choices. 
  - [ ] AI systems create bias on their own. Some biases are baked into technology always, regardless of training data.

+ What core problem does Agile methodology solve that Waterfall methodology doesn't?
  - [x] The ability to adapt to changing requirements while continuously delivering working software
  - [ ] The ability to create comprehensive documentation before development begins
  - [ ] The ability to plan the entire project timeline with precise milestones
  - [ ] The ability to minimize stakeholder meetings and maximize development time

+ Why is version control fundamental to modern software development?
  - [ ] It provides automatic code optimization and performance improvements during development
  - [x] It enables concurrent development while maintaining code history and managing merge conflicts
  - [ ] It enforces coding standards and prevents developers from introducing bugs
  - [ ] It generates comprehensive documentation of all code changes automatically

+ How does AI fundamentally change software development?
  - [ ] It automates the entire development process through code generation and testing
  - [ ] It provides perfect solutions to complex problems through advanced algorithms
  - [ ] It eliminates the need for human decision-making in software architecture
  - [x] It enables systems to improve performance through data analysis without explicit programming

+ What is the key benefit of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) in software development?
  - [ ] It ensures that all code changes are reviewed by multiple teams before deployment
  - [ ] It automates the entire development process without human intervention
  - [x] It allows for rapid feedback, testing, and deployment of code changes
  - [ ] It guarantees that all code changes are bug-free before deployment

+ Which prioritization scheme is more simple, Moscow or Cost of Delay?
  - [x] Moscow
  - [ ] Cost of Delay

+ Which of the following is an example of a DevOps practice? Choose
  the one best option.
  - [ ] Writing comprehensive documentation before starting development
  - [ ] Using version control
  - [ ] Placing application servers behind load-balancing reverse proxies
  - [x] Automatically deploying code changes to a CI/CD pipeline

+ A story on an agile scrum team's Kanban board likely has which of the
  following. Select all that apply.
  - [x] A title
  - [x] A priority
  - [x] An acceptance criteria
  - [x] An estimate of effort

+ We are trying to decrease churn. We might use which of the following?
  Select the one best option.
  - [ ] A DNS server that is closer to customers
  - [x] The Pirate Metrics
  - [ ] A NoSQL database
  - [ ] An MVC architecture

+ A developer is not working on the stories that they selected. In what
  scrum meeting is this raised?
  - [ ] Sprint Backlog Grooming
  - [ ] Sprint Planning
  - [x] Sprint Retrospective
  - [ ] Spring Demo

+ We decide to make our mobile website snappier by using smaller 
  images for mobile devices. Where would we _most naturally_ make this change?
  - [ ] In the database
  - [ ] In the MVC application server
  - [x] In CSS
  - [ ] In HTML

+ You're building an e-commerce app that you hope to grow. Where you turn first for data persistence?
  - [x] A relational database
  - [ ] A NoSQL database
  - [ ] A key-value store
  - [ ] A columnar store
