2. What is Andreessen's argument about running internet applications?
- The cost plummeted with cloud computing (*)
- On-premises servers would be more cost-effective
- AI would make cloud computing obsolete
- The internet would be replaced by a new technology

3. Which of the following best describes Andreessen's perspective on the relationship between software and traditional industries?
- Software will completely replace traditional industries
- Traditional industries will resist software integration
- Software will augment but not fundamentally change traditional industries
- Software will transform traditional industries, often led by new entrants (*)

4. According to Andreessen's thesis, what is the primary driver enabling software to "eat the world"?
- Increased venture capital funding for tech but not for non-tech companies
- Government regulations favoring tech companies
- Convergence of technological readiness and reduced barriers to entry (*)
- Declining interest in traditional industry careers

6. Which of the following best represents Andreessen's view on the challenges faced by new software companies?
- They primarily face competition from established tech giants
- Their main obstacle is a lack of available venture capital
- They must overcome economic headwinds while proving their worth and justifying valuations (*)
- Their growth is primarily limited by government regulations

2. What is the primary purpose of "capacity management" in Agile development?
- To maximize the number of stories completed, but not necessarily per sprint
- To ensure the team is always working at 100% capacity based on head count
- To maintain a sustainable pace and avoid overload (*)
- To increase the team's velocity over time, subject to team size
- To minimize the time spent on each user story

4. How does the concept of "Yesterday's Weather" in Scrum relate to capacity planning?
- It uses weather forecasts to predict team productivity
- It suggests basing future capacity on recent past performance (*)
- It recommends adjusting capacity based on seasonal changes
- It proposes increasing capacity incrementally each sprint
- It advises using external factors to determine capacity

5. What is the primary goal of backlog grooming sessions?
- To increase the number of stories in the backlog
- To remove low-priority items from the backlog based on updates from the sprint demo
- To refine, estimate, and prioritize backlog items (*)
- To assign stories to team members based on expertise and interest
- To update the project timeline for stakeholders

6. In Agile development, why is there often no correlation between a story's value and its size?
- High-value stories are always more complex but time to code depends on technology choices
- Story size is determined by stakeholder importance during the sprint demo
- Value is subjective while size is objective
- Simple features can have high impact and complicated features low impact (*)
- Larger stories always provide more value to the product

7. What is the main purpose of using a story burn-up chart in Agile project management?
- To track individual developer productivity so that productive developers can be rewarded.
- To visualize project progress and forecast completion (*)
- To determine the optimal sprint length based on "yesterday's weather"
- To allocate resources across multiple projects where a technical team might be divided
- To measure the quality of delivered features which might not have well fleshed out stories

8. According to the Scrum Guide, what is the primary role of the Scrum Master?
- To manage the development team
- To write code and contribute to the product
- To promote and support Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide (*)
- To prioritize the Product Backlog
- To represent stakeholders' interests

11. Which of the following is NOT considered a key element of the agile methodology by experienced scrum advocates?
- Release early and often
- Test as you go
- Document as you go, and only as needed
- Gather all product requirements before you build any software (*)
- Build cross-functional teams

12. According to agile project management principles, story point estimation (or work estimation) is best done by:
- The most experienced individual on the team
- The entire development team collaboratively (*)

13. Which of the following is NOT one of the agile values as detailed in the Agile Manifesto?
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
- Document twice, build once (*)
