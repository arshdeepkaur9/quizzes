1. What is the primary goal of a design sprint?

- To solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users (*)
- To create a finalized product ready for market launch
- To train new team members in UX design principles
- To develop long-term marketing strategies for a product

2. Which is the correct sequence of phases in a design sprint?

- Understand, Ideate, Decide, Prototype, Test (*)
- Understand, Decide, Ideate, Prototype, Test
- Ideate, Understand, Decide, Prototype, Test
- Understand, Prototype, Ideate, Decide, Test
- Test, Prototype, Decide, Ideate, Understand


4. Why is user testing an essential part of the design sprint process?

- It validates the prototype with real users before expensive decisions are made (*)
- It helps in recruiting new users for the product
- It replaces the need for market research
- It finalizes the design without the need for further iterations

5. What makes design sprints beneficial for teams?

- They save time by reducing decision-making from months to a single week (*)
- They eliminate the need for cross-functional collaboration
- They guarantee a successful product launch without needing too much user feedback
- They focus on the business's needs over the user's needs, resulting in higher profits


9. Which hand position is most common for mobile users, according to Steven Hoober's research?

- Using both hands equally
- Using one finger of the non-dominant hand
- Using one thumb to interact with the device (*)
- Using a stylus or external device

11. In the context of **design sprints**, what is the role of the "sprint master"?

- To make all final design decisions
- To guide the team through the sprint process (*)
- To develop the prototype single-handedly
- To test the prototype with users

15. Why should negative actions (like delete or erase) be placed in hard-to-reach areas in mobile design?

- To comply with design trends from Smash Magazine
- To prevent accidental taps by the user (*)
- To make the app look balanced, like Apple's design
- To encourage users to explore the app more

16. When you type a URL into your browser, which likely happens first?

- The browser requests the IP address of the domain from a DNS server (*)
- The browser issues an HTTP request to the server hosting the website
- The browser loads CSS, JS, images, and other assets specified in the HTML
- The browser receives missing packets via TCP/IP
- The browser parses the DOM and then generates the request

17. Imagine you've just made some git commits and are going home for the day.
    What command should you run before you leave to save your work?

- `git push` (*)
- `git branch`
- `git merge main`
- `git add`
- `git log`

18. Imagine a developer tries to take credit for another person's work and
    alters a previous commit to add their name as the author. Why wouldn't
    this work?

- Git history is immutable, and changing a commit would change its hash (*)
- Git would automatically detect the change and reject it
- Git would merge the two authors' names in the commit history, show both
- This actually would work
- Git would require the original author's permission to change the commit

19. Imagine you're a PM, and a developer tells you they've found a bug in the
    code. What should you do next?

- Ask the developer to fix the bug immediately
- Add the bug to the backlog and prioritize it based on its severity (*)
- Ignore the bug if it's not critical to the product
- Add the bug to this sprint but don't have it fixed today necessarily
- Subtract the story points represented by the bug from the burndown chart

20. Where are passwords best stored?

- The client-side
- The server-side (*)
- The network

21. One of your developers makes a bunch of changes to your HTML structure. You
    would expect that your design, implemented in CSS, would _likely_:

- Need fixes (*)
- Still work

22. Consider these HTTP status codes: 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx and match them with
    these lay explanations from the perspective of the server:

- Ok, see over there, you messed up, I messed up (*)
- I need something else, Ok, I messed up, see over there
- I messed up, Ok, see over there, I need something else
- You messed up, I messed up, see over there, Ok
